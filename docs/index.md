# First visit

## Do's and dont's
* Be open minded. The group will help you. They will tell you when to join and when it's better to watch. 
* Don't ask your neigbour/partner for help. Raise your arm. It is absolutely perfect to ask every question.

## Dressing
* No high heels. No Sneekers. I started with gymnastics shoes.

## Preparation
